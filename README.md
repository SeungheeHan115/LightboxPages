# Lightbox

This is a basic invoice creator script for INSEUM USA's Lightbox product. A Lightbox is a metal frame with LEDs outlining the edges of the frame to light up the picture in the middle.

This program calculates the number of lights needed to fit the frame. It is built to be modular, as you can easily add or delete products since they are placed in classes.
